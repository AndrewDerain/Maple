# Code Concepts [KB00001]

**Simplify the grammar**

- Use the most simplest grammar to achieve your goal.
- Easy to read
- Easy to code
- Easy to config
- Easy to deploy

**The version of C++ Language and relevant tools**

- C++ 20
- CMake 3.20

**Make Code As Comment**
- Write meaningful comments.
- Please refactor your code where user can not understand the purpose. 

**Naming grammar rule**

  | SymbolType      | Meaning                      | Part of speech   | Example               |
  |:----------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
  | interface | Describe "What can be done." | Adjective phrase | IRunnable             |
  | class     | Describe "What is it."       | Noun phrase      | Runner                |
  | function  | Define "What to do."         | Verb phrase      | Run, Stop             |
  |  property | Describe "Status"            | Noun phrase      | Status, Height, Width |

**Keep namespace clean**

- Only put things that library user would use into the namespace "Maple". 
  Any other things you should put them into namespace "_Maple".


**Integer number**
    
- Use 64-bit Integer first. Never save memory space in order to save memory space.
- Do not recommend use unsigned integer number. Avoid the conversion between signed and unsigned type.

**Floating number**

- Use 64-bit floating number first.
- Please use type "Double" in place of "double". Double overloaded operators `==, <=, >=, >, <`, 
  and can be compared with these operators directly.

**Enumeration**

- Recommend Use 64-bit integer as base of enum.
- Wrap up enum with structure, with the help of macro EnumerationImplementation。

```C++
struct TradeDirection
{
    EnumerationImplementation(TradeDirection, 
        BuyOpen, BuyClose, SellOpen, SellClose
    )

    inline bool IsBuy() const {
        return _Value == BuyOpen || _Value == BuyClose;
    }

    inline bool IsSell() const {
        return _Value == SellOpen || _Value == SellClose;
    }

    inline bool IsOpen() const {
        return _Value == BuyOpen || _Value == SellOpen;
    }

    inline bool IsClose() const {
        return _Value == BuyClose || _Value == SellClose;
    }
};

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    TradeDirection Direction = {}; // ok
    TradeDirection Direction = TradeDirection::SellOpen; // ok

    // Now you can assign enum by the following grammar.
    Direction = Direction.BuyOpen; 
    // Or like this.
    Direction = TradeDirection::BuyOpen;

    // And convert enum to string by the method ToString.
    std::cout << Direction.ToString() << std::endl;

    // Next, you can assign enum from string.
    Direction.FromString("BuyOpen");
    if(Direction == Direction.BuyOpen) {
        std::cout << "Success assign from string!" << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Failed assign from string!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Call the methods inside the enum.
    if(Direction.IsBuy()) {
        std::cout << "Direction is buy! [" << Direction.ToString() << "]" << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Direction is not buy! [" << Direction.ToString() << "]" << std::endl;
    }

    // Use TradeDirection as native enum in the switch.
    switch(Direction) {   
        case TradeDirection::BuyOpen:
            std::cout << "In switch scop: Direction is buy! [" << Direction.ToString() << "]" << std::endl;
            break;
    }

    return 0；
}
```

**The order in which members of a class are defined**

```c++
class YourClass 
{
public:
    // SymbolType definition，Use 'using' in place of 'typedef'.

    // static methods

    // properties

    // constructors destructors

    // methods

    // overloaded operators

protected:
    // ...

private:
    // ...
};
```
